Omnipotence of God
------------------

> Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."
<cite>Revelation 19:6</cite>

> Nothing is hard for God -- nothing whatsoever. Nothing! In all God's wisdom and power He is able to do anything as easily as He is able to do anything else.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Attributes of God, Volume 2</cite>

[???

* What would it be like if our omniscient, omnipotent God was not also good?
* Do you sometimes not ask God for help, because you think it is too hard, or He'll choose not to come through?
* Why does God sometimes respond immediately and other times wait? What is He waiting for?

???]

Omnipotent means "all powerful". In the English Bible, Omnipotent is often translated as "almighty". This word is never used to describe anyone other than God, for God alone is almighty. Since God is infinite, He has limitless power and strength. Since God is self-sufficient, He never gets tired, nor will ever need to reset. God is the creator, and all strength and power is given as a gift from Him and is rooted in Him. Nothing is _too hard_ for God, because God has no concept of _hard_. Moving a marble and moving a mountain are just as easy for Him. In fact, He is literally what is keeping the universe together. In science we talk about the "laws of nature" which are just phenomenon which is observed to be constant (like gravity). In reality, these are laws that God set ... and He enforces them!

We often talk of doing things in our own strength, as opposed to doing it in God's strength. In reality, everything is in God's strength, for there is no strength, energy, or indeed life apart from God. God will bless you with more strength if we acknowledge Him and use His strength to accomplish His will. Why does God bless us with strength? Because we are His children. We get to call the infinitely powerful God "daddy". God cares for you and can just as easily heal your heartache as He can your toothache.

Sovereignty of God
------------------

> "O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done?" declares the LORD. "Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel."
<cite>Jeremiah 18:6 ESV</cite>

> To say that God is sovereign is to say that He is supreme over all things, that there is no one above Him, that He is absolute Lord over creation. It is to say that His Lordship over creation means that there is nothing out of His control, nothing that God hasn't foreseen and planned.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Attributes of God, Volume 2</cite>

[???

* How can our free will coexist with God's sovereignty?
* How does knowing that there are no accidents or coincidences change our outlook on life?
* Is there something that God has been calling you to do? Or is God calling you to "drop anchor" and wait out the storm?

???]

God's sovereignty means that He is the ultimate ruler of the universe. He asks permission from no one and every single decree that He gives will be carried out. God is omnipotent and since He has ultimate power, He has ultimate authority. There is no one that can thwart His plans. In addition, since He is wise and omniscient, this means everything, every tiny minute detail, was carefully planned out. With God, there are no accidents or coincidences in your life. There is nothing outside of His control, nothing that God hasn't foreseen and planned.

Sometimes people will say that God can do anything, but that isn't entirely true. God can do anything _He wills to do_. God cannot tell a lie, for example, for that is against His nature. God is sovereign, so it is impossible for Him to break promises that He has made in His Word; God will complete in you the work He has started, for it is impossible for Him to do otherwise. God doesn't need us, nor our help. He will accomplish His will without our help. However, He chooses to use us, not because He needs us, but because He wants to bless us. Sometimes this means going forth and waging war against the enemy and sometimes this means staying put, trusting that He will tell you when is the right time to make your move.
