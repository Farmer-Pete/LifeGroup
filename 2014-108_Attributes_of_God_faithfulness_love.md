Faithfulness of God
-------------------

> I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
<cite>Psalm 89:1</cite>

> Upon God's faithfulness rests our whole hope of future blessedness ... The tempted, the anxious, the fearful, the discouraged may all find new hope and good cheer in the knowledge that our Heavenly Father is faithful.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The knowledge of the Holy</cite>

[???

* What causes us to become unfaithful?
* Do we unconsciously believe that God will work somewhere else, sometime else, through someone else ... but not here, now, and through us? Why?
* In the scripture that was listed, was there any particular promise that spoke to something you are facing?

???]

To say that God is faithful means that God will never act inconsistently with Himself. Everything that God says or does will be in accord with His faithfulness. He will always be true to Himself and His creation. This means that *nothing* can force God to act in a way that is unfaithful. No person or circumstance can come into our life that causes God to rethink His plans. Nothing surprises or blindsides our omniscient God. Nothing can prevent Him from faithfully fulfilling his plans and promises.

The faithfulness of God comes with both a warning and a blessing. The warning is that God is faithful to bring judgment upon those who are pursing a sinful lifestyle ... He isn't someone who threatens and doesn't follow through! God records hundreds of promises in the Bible: God will forgive and cleanse us from our sins if we confess them ([1 John 1:9](http://esv.to/1John1:9)), He will be fulfill His calling in you ([1 Thessalonians 5:24](http://esv.to/1Thes5:24)), He will give us rest ([Matthew 11:28](http://esv.to/Mat11:28)) and peace ([Isiah 54:10](http://esv.to/Isiah54:10)), He always provides a way out of temptation ([1 Corinthians 10:13](http://esv.to/1Cor10:13)) ... and hundreds more. He is faithful and able to fulfill each one!





Love of God
-----------

> This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
<cite>1 John 4:9,10 NIV</cite>

> Every time God thinks about you, He thinks about you lovingly. Even if He must chastise you, or allow hardships to come to you, it is love that allows it to come and love that sends it. And we never should be afraid of love, because love casts out fear.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Attributes of God, Volume 2</cite>

[???

* Since "perfect love casts out fear", is fear an indication that we don't fully understand God's love?
* How can we share the love of God with our fellow man?
* Have you ever thought about God getting emotional about you?

???]

We have all sung "Jesus loves me, this I know", countless times. However, what does it mean that God loves us? Firstly, it means that God wants the very best for you. He is not a vengeful god that is looking for any excuse to smite you. He wants to bless you and wants you to live a happy, fruitful life (and only He knows what that looks like). It was out of His love that He sent his son to redeem the human race ([John 3:16](http://esv.to/John3:16)).

Secondly, God's love involves emotion. Because God cares for you, He is angry and hurt when you sin. He is sorrowful when we suffer and go through trials ([Isaiah 53:4](http://esv.to/Isaiah53:4)). He rejoices and is pleased when we have victory. He is emotionally invested in you!

Lastly, we have all heard that "God is love" and many people have used that as a platform to point out all the seemingly unloving things that God does or allows. This is why we must look to God and allow Him to define what love is, rather than bringing our agendas and preconceived notions of what love is and then attempting to shoehorn God into them.
