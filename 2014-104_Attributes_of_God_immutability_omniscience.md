God is Immutable and Omniscient

Immutability of God
-------------------

> For I the LORD do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.
<cite>Malachi 3:6 ESV</cite>

> God will not compromise and He need not be coaxed. He cannot be persuaded to alter His word nor talked into answering selfish prayer. In all our efforts to find God ... we should remember that all change must be on our part
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Knowledge of the Holy</cite>

[???

* Why does God seem so different in the Old/New Testament when He doesn't change?
* In Exodus 32, when the people made the golden calf and God wanted to destroy the Israelites, did Moses "talk Him out of it"? How do you reconcile this with His immutability?
* What things in your life are influencing how you change?

???]

To say that God is immutable goes beyond stating that God *will not* change; it means that he *cannot* change. God is already infinitely Holy, loving, powerful and wise. There is no "improving" upon God, for He cannot get better than He already is. God also cannot get "worse" or He would cease to be God. God is immutable because he is perfect, any deviation (no matter how slight) and he would not be God. Think back for a moment, to last week's study on God's eternalness, how all time rests on God. Hebrews 13:8 says "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." God exists outside of time so He *must* be and remain the same for our one God exists in our past, present, and future ... all at the same time.

God remains unchanging for all eternity. We change day by day (and often many times a day). For God, change is impossible or he would not be God. For us, we cannot stop changing ... and praise God! To live in a world filled with childish people, where there was no hope for change of maturity ... would be a dreadful world indeed. However, in all our changing, we must remember two things. Firstly, God does not change. If He appears to, we must examine ourselves, for it is our perception and understanding of Him that is changing. Secondly, keep in mind that things we let into our minds change us.

Omniscience of God
------------------


> He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.  Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.
<cite>Pslam 147:3-5 ESV</cite>

> We can't tell God anything He doesn't already know and we can't excuse ourselves for anything. Our reasons are paper-thin and God sees through them. But in spite of it, God loves you and God will receive you.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Attributes of God, Volume 2</cite>

[???

* Why do we try to hide (like Adam and Jonah) from an omniscient God?
* Is the fact that God knows everything comfort or a terror (or both)?
* How do we transfer "head" knowledge to "heart" knowledge?

???]

God is omniscience, meaning that he knows everything. Not only does God know everything, he knows *EVERYTHING*. He has all knowledge about how your body works (or sometimes doesn't work), all the secrets of the universe, why your computer is acting up, the best way to solve the dilemma you're facing, and why your best friend has been acting strange around you. He knows everything that has happened, is currently going on, and will happen in the future. It is impossible for God to ever learn anything ... not because He isn't smart enough, but because there is nothing else to learn. Before the Earth even existed, He already knew everything.

Because God knows you, He knows you. He knows you better than you know yourself. He knows your fears, strengths, weakness, victories, and secret sins you think no one knows about. Since God knows everything, when we God entrusts us with a task or allows us to encounter a trial, He knows it isn't too much for your handle. He knows all your insecurity and doubts and how it will ultimately turn out.
