Sit And Be Still
================

<header markdown=1>
Many of us understand that we can't work our way to Heaven, but still think we can (and need to) work our way to a more fruitful Christian life.

Salvation is all God
--------------------

> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is **not your own doing**; it is the gift of God.
<cite>Ephesians 2:8-9 ESV (emphasis added)</cite>

[???

* How would you explain the Gospel in just a couple of sentences?
* Why was it important that God did all the saving, instead of meeting us "half way"?

???]

Hell is a place of such horrific magnitude that it exceeds our comprehension, and even our imagination.  It was from this damnation that God snatched you.  Instead of letting the judgement you rightly deserved come crashing down upon your head, He instead suffered the horrendous consequences for your sin and in return showered you with blessings.  His sacrifice and exchange is astonishing. Hallelujah!

But we had a part to play in all this, too ... right?  We believed and accepted His sacrifice by praying and "letting Jesus in to our hearts".  Ephesians 2:1 says "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins". Dead ... that's how the Bible describes us.  It is true that we believed, but that was only by God's grace and power.

Salvation is (still) all God
----------------------------

> **Be still, and know that I am God**. I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!
<cite>Psalm 46:10 ESV (emphasis added)</cite>

[???

* Why is it so hard to be still and trust a God who is completely trustworthy?
* In trying to be "good Christian", do you think you're really trying to "earn" God's empowering?

???]

As we have just seen, our salvation from Hell was not our own doing; it was all God. Likewise, after being born again into Christ's kingdom, we are no more able to deliver ourselves from temptations, trials, and tribulations than we were able to deliver ourselves from God's condemnation. We need Christ's empowering, but it isn't something we can earn.

Rescuing a drowning victim is dangerous as they often panic, drowning them both. Often rescuers have to wait until the victim becomes so exhausted, that they don't fight anymore. Could it be that when we are "victims", drowning in daily challenges ... wondering where God is in all of this, that He is right beside us, waiting for us to become so exhausted that we finally stop fighting, fully relying on His deliverance?

Sitting Your Way to Victory
---------------------------

> ... [God] raised him [Jesus] from the dead and **seated him** at his right hand in the heavenly places ... and raised us up with him and **seated us with him** in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus
<cite>Ephesians 1:20-21,2:6 ESV</cite>

[???

* Is your life rooted in an attitude of rest?
* How can we re-orient our lives around this attitude in such a crazy busy culture?

???]

The American psyche is rooted the notion that we can achieve anything if we work hard enough for it. However, with God, we must be rooted, not in doing, but in sitting ... for after raising us up, he first seated us with Him. Before sending us out, he first sat us down.

We are to be rooted in an attitude of rest. When we sit down, we are not struggling to accomplish a task, but are resting in the knowledge that the task is completed. Of course we will often still need to take action. However, instead of anxiously struggling in our own strength, we can be at peace knowing that victory is already at hand.

This also means that it is not by our own laborings that we achieve victory. Earnestly pleading to God, fasting, and denying ourselves of pleasure are all things that are valuable in the Christian walk. However, the seated Christian does not do these things in an effort to barter with or convince God to help. God loves us and has already given us the victory! We do these things because we love Him and want to please Him.
