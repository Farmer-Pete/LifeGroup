Wisdom of God
-------------------

> ...
<cite>Romans 16:27 ESV</cite>

> God will not compromise and He need not be coaxed. He cannot be persuaded to alter His word nor talked into answering selfish prayer. In all our efforts to find God ... we should remember that all change must be on our part
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Knowledge of the Holy</cite>

* What is the difference between wisdom and shrewdness?

???]

* The idea that God is infinitely wise is the root of all truth.
* Two different types of wisdom: Wisdom of God (and of the Bible) is pure, loving and good. The other is is mere shrewdness and is treacherous and false.
* "Wisdom, among other things, is the ability to devise perfect ends and to achieve those ends by the most perfect means."
* Wisdom sees everything in focus, each in proper relationship to all, and is thus able to work toward predestined goals with flawless precision.
*  Not only could God's acts not be done better, a better way to do them could not be imagined
* Without creation, the wisdom of God would have remained forever locked away in God. God brought His creatures into being that He might enjoy them and they rejoice in Him. "And God saw everything that he had maid and behold it was very good"
    * Many people have declared that they are unable to believe in God where so much appears to be wrong
        * Prov 3:19
        * "Our concern is not to explain but proclaim"
    * It is true that currently the world is not the best of all possible worlds, but that is because of the Fall.
    * God is all knowing and wise. Why then would He create man if He knew He would fall?
        * Because He wanted to show Himself a deliverer?
        * Because He wanted to demonstrate His love and His awesomeness
        * The operation of the gospel, the new birth, the coming of the Holy Spirit into human nature, the ultimate triumph of Good over evil and the final establishment of Christ's righteous kingdom -- all these have flowedand do flow out of Gods ininte fullness of wisdom
        * Are we willing to put ourselves in similar situations where we know there is "no good outcome", but it would be worse without us?
            * Many people would probably say that is not a wise thing to do ... but wisdom is not looking to pick the path most confortable for us, but relying on God's wisdom ([see quote above])
    * Our "golden age" is not in the past, in the Garden of Eden, but is in the future ... Heaven
    * Any faith that must be supported by the evidence of the senses is not real faith.
        * The testimony of faith is that no matter how things look in this fallen world, all God's acts are wrought in perfect wisdom.
* Most of us go through life praying a little, planning a little, jockeying for position, hoping but never being quite certain of anything, and always secretly afraid that we will miss the way. This is a tragic waste of truth and never gives rest to the heart. There is a better way. It is to abandon our own wisdom and take, instead the infinite wisdom of God.
* The wisdom of God is something to be taken on faith. We do not reason in order that we might believe, but we reason because we already believe. If I have to reason myself into faith, than I can be reasoned back out of it again.
    * The three things we must accept as fact and in faith is that He is God, He is wise, and that He is good
    * He has got to be wise or else you and I cannot be sure of anything. He's got to be good or heaven would be a hill and hell a heaven (since hell is the absence of God, but is not hell if God is not good)
* If God is good an wise, how do you explain polio,prison camps, mass executions, wars and all the other evils that in the world? Many people life in a bed of suffering or go about with one leg or are def or blind. And if God is good and wise then how will you explain how this could be?
    * God created the Earth to be perfect and pure. However, it us currently under foreign occupation and all these things are caused by the evil in the world. God could eradicate the evil but in His Wisdom (and foresight) is allowing it for a time
* "[Wisdom] is the skill the achieve the most perfect ends by the most perfect means ... Wisdom is the ability to see the end from the beginning, to see everything in proper relation and in full focus."


Omniscience of God
------------------


> He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names.  Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.
<cite>Pslam 147:3-5 ESV</cite>

> We can't tell God anything He doesn't already know and we can't excuse ourselves for anything. Our reasons are paper-thin and God sees through them. But in spite of it, God loves you and God will receive you.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Attributes of God, Volume 2</cite>

[???

* Why do we try to hide (like Adam and Jonah) from an omniscient God?
* Is the fact that God knows everything comfort or a terror (or both)?
* How do we transfer "head" knowledge to "heart" knowledge?

???]

God is omniscience, meaning that he knows everything. Not only does God know everything, he knows *EVERYTHING*. He has all knowledge about how your body works (or sometimes doesn't work), all the secrets of the universe, why your computer is acting up, the best way to solve the dilemma you're facing, and why your best friend has been acting strange around you. He knows everything that has happened, is currently going on, and will happen in the future. It is impossible for God to ever learn anything ... not because He isn't smart enough, but because there is nothing else to learn. Before the Earth even existed, He already knew everything.

Because God knows you, He knows you. He knows you better than you know yourself. He knows your fears, strengths, weakness, victories, and secret sins you think no one knows about. Since God knows everything, when we God entrusts us with a task or allows us to encounter a trial, He knows it isn't too much for your handle. He knows all your insecurity and doubts and how it will ultimately turn out.
