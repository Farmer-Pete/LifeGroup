God is Eternal and Infinite

Eternity of God
-----------------

> Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God.
<cite>Psalm 90:2 ESV</cite>

> The mind looks backward in time till the dim point vanishes, then turns and looks into the future till the thought and imagination collapse from exhaustion; and God is at both points, unaffected by either
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Knowledge of the Holy</cite>

* How do we keep a balance between obeying the command to "number our days" and being a slave to time (with a crazy-packed schedule)?
* God is never surprised by events as He sees all time laid out before Him. How can we keep this in focus while in the midst of such an event?
* Can you share a testimony of God's timing, where he provided what you needed exactly when you needed it?

God has neither beginning nor end. He is the "Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come" ([Revelation 4:8](http://esv.to/rev 4:8)). God created time, yet is not affected by it. Not only does He live apart from time, but all time is in God. We see time as a series of events that constantly marches forward. He sees all time laid out before Him. To God, all eternity future is just as clear as looking at the present time or eternity past.

As God is eternal, He is the only place to rest in as He has been there for all eternity past and will continue to be there for all eternity future. We often lose sight of this and pray to God in a panic. Although we were caught off guard by a looming circumstance, God has known about this exact trial for all eternity. Although we wish God to provide deliverance far in advance (sometimes He does), He never is late. God always has perfect timing.

Infinitude of God
------------------


> If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
<cite>Colossians 3:1-3 ESV</cite>

> When we say that God is infinite we mean that He knows no bounds. Whatever God is and all that God is, He is without limit ... Because God's nature is infinite, everything that flows out of it is infinite also.
<cite>A.W. Tozer -- The Knowledge of the Holy</cite>

* What are some practical ways that we can set our minds on things that are above?
* When we are in the midst of a panic, how do we stop and remind ourselves of our God who is infinitely powerful?
* How do we have faith like a child without having childish faith?

God is infinite, limitless, and unbounded. It boggles the mind to even attempt to understand this. God's infinitude affects his other attributes as well. Not only is God loving, but He is infinitely loving. No matter how many times we mess up, God is infinitely merciful and patient. He is so infinitely holy that to even glance upon His face is instant death. He is infinitely powerful and nothing is too big for him.

God and His word are fountains from which we will never be able to exhaust. When confronted by a trial or even an unknown, we often first consult "experts", friends, and random postings on the Internet. However, our first thought should be of God; we should be consulting Him both by reading His word and in prayer. We need to heed the words of Psalm 27:8 "You have said, 'Seek my face.' My heart says to you, 'Your face, LORD, do I seek.'". We will never find God inadequate or lacking in any way.
