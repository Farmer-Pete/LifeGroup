Self-existance
Exodus 3:11-15
* "To admine that there is ONe who lies beyond us, who exists outide of all our categories, who will not be dismissed with a name, who will not appear wbefore the bar of our reason, nor submit to our curious inquiries: this requires a great dea l of hility, more than most of us posess, who we save face by thinking GOd down to our leve, or at least down to where we can manage Him."
* I AM THAT I AM
* we were made in the image of God ... our (and all of Creation) existance depends on HIS existance
* "We can never know who are what we are till we know at least something of what GOd is. FOr this reason the self-eistance of God is not a wisp of dry doctine, academic and remote" <-- Why should we care / study this?
* "Man is a created being, a derived and contingent self, who of himself posssesses nothing but ins dependent each moment ofr his existance upon the One who created him after His own likeness."
* We are created in God's likeness, but sin enteres in when we try to be "like God" by taking on attributes that only rightly belong to Him. "The natural man is a sinner because and only because he challenges God's selfhood in relation to his own. If all else he may willingly acce[t the sovereignty of God; in his own life he relecects it. For him, God's dominion ends where his begins. For Him, self becomes Self, and in this unconsciously immitates Lucifer, that fallen son of the morning."
* "Yet so subtle is self that scarely any one is conscious of its presence"
* "BIBLE: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God ..."
* We were created ... what were we created for?
* If we were created, then we are accountable to the creator
* The created wants to assert himself over the creator
* Why does God exist? ... certianly not to just give us what we want!
* "That's why it's not always easy to get people to become real Christians. YOu can get them to sign a card, or make a decision, or join a church, or something like that. But to get people delivered from their sin a pretty hard deal because it means that I've got to get off that throne. God belongs on that throne but sin as pushed God off an taken over." (Attributes vol2)

Self-sufficiency
* "No creature has life in itself, all life as a gift from God"
* That is not just a one time gift, but a continual gift. We are forever dependent on God's gift of life (i.e. we are not self-sufficient)
* God doesnt need anthing ... especially not our help!
* Sometimes we feel like God is dependent on us ... that He needs us to worship Him
* "Where all himan beings suddely to become blind, still the sun would shine by day and the stars by night, for these owe nothing to the millions who benefit from their light. So, where every man on earth to become atheist, it could not affect God is any way. He is what He is in Himself without reguard to any other. To believe in Him adds nothing to His perfections; to doubt Him takes nothing away."
* God pursues us for our benefit ... not His
* "From all thise we may begin to understand why the Hold Scriptures have so much to say about the vital place of faith and why they brand unbelief as a deadly sin. Among all created beings, not one dare trust in itself. God alone trusts in Himself; all other beings must trust in Him. Unbeliefe is actually perverted faith, for it puts it strust not in the living God but in dying men. The unbelieve denies the self-sufficiency of God and usurps attrubtes that are not his. THe dual sin dishonors God ultimately dstroys the sol of the man."
* We also need one another (community)!
