God's Self-Existence
--------------------

> God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'" ... This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.
<cite>Exodus 3:14-15 ESV</cite>


> ... it's not always easy to get people to become real Christians. You can get them to sign a card, or make a decision, or join a church, or something like that. But to get people delivered from their sin is a pretty hard deal because it means that I've got to get off that throne. God belongs on that throne but sin has pushed God off and taken over.
<cite>A.W. Tozer (The Attributes of God, volume 2)</cite>

* What other attributes of God are rooted in His self-existence?
* Why do we wish to explain away our creator? What does it mean if we were created?
* Are there any attributes that rightly belong only to God that you are trying to assert?

### The God who Is ###

God has no beginning or end. It's hard to fathom, but God has existed for all eternity past and will continue to exist for all eternity. His self-existence is foundational to many of his other attributes. For example, since He needed no one to create Him, He needs no one to sustain Him (He is self-sufficient). Since He has no beginning, He has no end (He is eternal). As no external force created Him, no external force can change him (He is immutable).

### Yielding to our Creator ###

God is self-existent, but our existence is dependent on God, as He is our creator. It is against this fact that we rail and kick against, turning to theories of evolution, in a desperate attempt to explain away the first several chapters of Genesis. It is this desire that is the foundation of our sin. For although God made us in His likeness and wants us to be like Him, our fallen nature wants to be "like God" in an incorrect way. God wishes for us to become more loving, merciful, and just. We wish to assert that we are self-sufficient, sovereign, and powerful. 



God's Self-Sufficiency
----------------------

> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.
<cite>John 5:26 ESV</cite>


> God alone trusts in Himself; all other beings must trust in Him. Unbelief is actually perverted faith, for it puts its trust not in the living God but in dying men. The unbelief denies the self-sufficiency of God and usurps attributes that are not his. The dual sin dishonors God and ultimately destroys the soul of the man.
<cite>A.W. Tozer (The Knowledge of the Holy)</cite>

[???

* As God doesn't need us and it would be easier for him to do things Himself, why does He still choose to work through us?
* This entire culture is obsessed with being self-sufficient (i.e. "independent"). What areas of your life are you trying to make it on your own?
* Is it wrong when we don't trust God? What's the difference between not understanding His ways and doubting one of God's attributes?

### The God who has Life ###


God is the only one that is truly self-sufficient. He is the source of all life; not just the miracle of birth and creation, but every day He grants a new measure of life to each of us. Many times we act (even subconsciously) as if God is in need of our praise and faith. God pursues us, but not because He will be lacking if we fail to turn to Him. He does not need us to accomplish His purposes, but chooses to use us for our benefit. As Tozer says "to believe in Him adds nothing to His perfections; to doubt Him takes nothing away."

### We, Who Need That Life ###

We are often like little children who cry "Daddy, I can do it myself!", even when we clearly can't. We need clarity of mind that comes from being in His word, the strength that comes from being filled by His spirit, and the encouragement that comes from being a part of His community. We are even in need of his constant gift of life and protection. However, we are constantly tempted to put our trust in ourselves and the work of our hands rather than the almighty God who is the only source of life.
