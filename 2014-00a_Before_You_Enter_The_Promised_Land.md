Before You Enter the Promised Land
==================================





<header markdown=1>

**Do you desire fruitfulness and prosperity?** I am confident that during the course of this life group year, **we will see those desires filled to supernatural proportions**. While God may (and does) bless us monetarily, I have been praying that God would make our lives bear **the fruits of the spirit**, prospering our efforts to **advance the kingdom of God**.

Let's look at Joshua, observing how they prepared to enter the promised land, taking Jericho, and tearing down an enemy stronghold. I believe these same preparations are critical to the success of our life group.

Read Your Bible
---------------

> Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, **but you shall meditate on it day and night**, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. **For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success**.
<cite>Joshua 1:7-8 ESV (emphasis added)</cite>

* How are you doing in your Bible reading? What steps can you take towards more consistency in this area?
* How can you integrate scripture meditation throughout the day?

To a Christian, the Bible is more than just a book, more than a collection of good teachings and nice stories. It is literally comprised of God's words -- which we cling to, daily soaking up its nourishment, knowing that it is paramount for our spiritual health and well being. However, beyond just meeting these needs, God promises extra benefits to those who don't just read -- but re-read, ponder, and ruminate until His words become part of us. For then we will hear His voice more clearly and will pursue things that please Him. It is in these efforts that we will prosper and have success.

Record and Share God's Goodness
-------------------------------

> ... take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder ... that this may be a sign among you. When your children ask in time to come, "**What do those stones mean to you?**" then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD ... **So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial forever**.
<cite>Joshua 4:5-7 ESV (emphasis added)</cite>

[???

* What has God done for you recently?
* What "memorials" can we build to tell the next generation of what God has done for us?

How good is your memory? How well do you remember the goodness, provision and deliverance of God? How quickly we forget! Here in Joshua, God supernaturally parted the Jordan. To make sure they wouldn't forget, the Israelites stacked stones together to memorialize and remember what God had done for them. Be it in a diary or a post-it note on the fridge, we need somewhere to make note of and record what God has done for us. In addition to recording, we need to share with others (Life group is a great place so that we can celebrate together!) In addition, we need to use this as teaching moments with our children, showing them how God provides.


Remove the foreskin of your hearts
----------------------------------

> At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time." So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.
<cite>Joshua 5:2-3 ESV</cite>

How badly do you want the promised land? The Israelites had to want it bad enough to, as adults, to have the most sensitive part of their bodies cut. Fortunately, physical circumcision is no longer required ([Romans 2](http://esv.to/Romans 2)), but God's ultimate purpose has always been in pursuit of the heart:

> For thus says the Lord to the men of Judah and Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. **Circumcise yourselves to the Lord**; **remove the foreskin of your hearts**, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds."
<cite>Jeremiah 4:3-4 ESV (emphasis added)</cite>

[???

* Where is God trying to work in your life? Are you resisting Him?
* What are some things God might be trying to "cut" out of your life?

???]

Have you formed an encrusted layer around your heart in self-preservation? Are there areas of your life that you've been unwilling to let God be Lord over? Can you think of any activities that are encroaching on or counterproductive to your time with the Lord? You must be willing to undergo God's knife, removing these things.

Lastly, note that although God requires both men and woman to make sacrifices, here God specifically calls out men. Men, take charge. Change in the home should start with you.

Just like the Israelites, we need to prepare our priorities, hearts, and lives to receive God's word and the blessings that flow from applying it properly. I can't wait to see what God is going to do this year during life group!
