Mission
-------

The mission of our life group is to support, encourage, and challenge each another toward leaving our comfort zones of complacency and pursuing full devotion to Christ in our personal, married, and family lives. 

Values
------

* **Community**: We desire to form healthy, authentic relationships and will support one another  both during and outside the group meetings
* **Authenticity**: We will be open, honest, and at times, vulnerable with one another
* **Respect**: We will honor each person's right to their opinions and keep what is shared, confined to the members of the group
* **Growth**: We desire to increase in our faith, understanding, and marriages. We also desire to add to the family of Christ

Vision
------

This is our vision, what we desire:

* **Marriages** that weather the storms of life and families that passes the torch of faith onto the next generation
Deepening relationships with Christ and authentic relationships with each other
* A **Self-replicating group** which continue and compound the disciple-making process
* **Communities** that are impacted for Christ

Theme
-----

The theme for the 2014-2015 life group is: "__sit, walk, stand__"

* **Sit**: Learning to sit still before God and encountering Christ
