Can we know God?
----------------

> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
    "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"
<cite>Romans 11:33-34 ESV</cite>

* God is too wonderful, too awesome for us to comprehend
* We can't know or understand God totally, we can just begin to scratch the surface with what He has revealed to us
* What He has revealed about Himself ... is what we call His attributes. They aren't his Only attributes, just the ones he hs revealed to us

Why should we try?
------------------

* If God is unknowable, why should we even try?
* Firstly, so that we can understand and worship him better. For example, goodness ... we get a glimpse of his goodness and then understand that he is waaaay more good than we could ever understand
* "The man who comes to a right belief about God is relieved of ten thousand problems ..."
* "The idolatrous heart assumes that God is other than He is ... and substitutes for the true God one made after his own likeness" | "The idolater simply imagines things about God and acts as if thy were true."

What are God's Attributes
-------------------------

* We have attributes. I love my wife (but don't act loving all the time)
* God has attributes, but He fulfills them perfectly. Not only is He perfectly loving all the time, but he IS love. Understanding God is understanding Love.
