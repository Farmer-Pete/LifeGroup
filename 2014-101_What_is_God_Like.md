What is God Like?
=================

<header markdown=1>
Almost of us (probably all of us) at some time or another have asked wondered "what is God like?". Although we can never completely answer that question, God has revealed certain aspects about Himself which we are able to study.

Can we Know God?
----------------

> Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
    "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"
<cite>Romans 11:33-34 ESV</cite>

[???

* We can't fully comprehend what God is like, much less his ways. Why then, do we question his actions?
* Why do the gods we create in our image differ from the God we were created in the image of?

???]


The first thing to know about God is that He is unknowable; the first thing to comprehend is that He is incomprehensible. God is too wonderful, too awesome, too amazing for us to begin to understand Him. Rather than this being disappointing or frustrating, this should be a source of awe and rejoicing. For if we, with our fallible and finite mind were able to fully grasp a complete understanding of God, He would not be God. Besides, we often have trouble understanding ourselves ... how would we wrap our mind around God?

Why should we try?
------------------

> Thus says the LORD: "Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD."
<cite>Jeremiah 9:23-24 ESV</cite>

[???

* What issues in your life can be traced back to an imperfect understanding of God?
* In what ways do your past and present experiences taint your understanding of God?

???]

If, with our limited mind, cannot grasp what God is like, why should we try?

1. **To understand and worship Him better** -- True, we can't grasp a full understanding of God. However, every glimpse that we get of Him and His glory should fill us with awe and reverence. Knowing Him will allow us to worship God, both in spirit and in truth.
2. **To keep us from idolatry** -- Tozer says, "the idolatrous heart assumes that God is other than He is ... and substitutes for the true God one made after his own likeness". We have many notions about God that we have obtained from our parents, tradition, and even our experiences. Without pursing an understanding of God, we won't know which of these notions aren't true.
3. **To keep us from sin** -- Many a sin and dysfunction can be traced back to a wrong thinking of God. Once we get our life rooted in a correct understanding of God, many questions and (self-inflected) problems will evaporate.

What are God's Attributes?
-------------------------

> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
<cite>1 John 4:8 ESV</cite>

[???

* What happens when we attempt to disassociate our attributes (ex: love) from the way God that God defines them?
* Prior to today, have you considered how God perfectly fulfills all His attributes all the time? How does this knowledge impact you?

???]

God has given us small glimpses of Himself, revealing various truths about his character. We refer to these collective revelations as "the attributes of God". God's attributes are very different than our own. Although we share some attributes in name, God fulfills them completely and perfectly. I very much love my wife, but I don't always act in love (even though I wish to). God on the other hand, is loving all the time, even when it feels to the contrary (when he executes judgement or correct us, for example).

In addition, our attributes describe only one aspect of our character. However, with God, each attribute of God describes his entire being all the time ... He perfectly fulfills each attribute. Not only is God perfectly loving all the time, He *IS* love. To understand God is to understand love.
