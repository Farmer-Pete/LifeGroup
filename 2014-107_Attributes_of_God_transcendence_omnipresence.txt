Transcendence of God
---------------------

[???

* How can we exalt Christ in our everyday life and conversations?
* Some parents instill the "fear of God" so their kids are terrified of God; others only teach God is our friend and buddy. What is the correct balance?

???]

* Transcendence = God is exalted far above the created universe, so much so that we can't even imagine it
    * Exalted in the terms of quality 
    * We must not "rank" God where He is the most exalted and something else is next.
        * The difference between the most and least exalted creature, however large, is finite. The chasm that separates God and even the most exalted creature is infinite.
* God is so far beyond us, yet He still puts a desire in our hearts to know Him
    * Not only does He make it possible, but He is pleased by our imperfect, stumbling attempts (that is only possible because He makes it so)
* The fear of God is not dread and feeling that God is dangerous / "out to get you"
    * It is a feeling that we are inadequate and insufficient to stand in the presence of almighty God
    * Although in the Bible people cried "Woe is me", fell to the ground, and hid their faces

Omnipresence of God
-------------------

[???

* What does it mean to "practice the presence of God"?
* How is it that sometimes we feel "closer" to God than others ... when God is always (literally) right next to us?

???]

* Omnipresence = God is everywhere
* The good news is that God is everywhere
    * There is no situation, no challenge, no temptation that God is not next to you, surrounding you
* The "bad" news is that God is everywhere
    * There is no hiding or escaping from God
    * We may try to block Him from our mind, but He is with us in every thought and action
